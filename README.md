## Overview

**TacticaML** is an ambitious open-source project that aims to create a high-accuracy machine learning system capable of predicting football (soccer) outcomes using massive-scale structured data extracted from [FBref.com](https://fbref.com). Through large-scale web scraping and advanced deep learning techniques, TacticaML seeks to build models that go beyond scores—forecasting performance, tactics, and results with precision.

This project is not just about scraping or training—it's about building a complete data-to-intelligence pipeline for football analytics.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **Automated Data Scraping**  
  Seamlessly crawls and collects structured football data from FBref, covering thousands of players, matches, clubs, and seasons.

- 📊 **High-Fidelity Datasets**  
  Extracted data is cleaned, normalized, and stored in reproducible formats ready for ML processing.

- 🤖 **Model Training with ML/DL**  
  Use machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning (LSTM, Transformer-based models) to train on match history and player performance data.

- 🧠 **Tactical Intelligence Models**  
  Aim to simulate decision-making, player form evolution, and tactical outcomes in predictive models.

- 📈 **Scalable & Modular**  
  Fully modular system for scraping, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and serving predictions.
